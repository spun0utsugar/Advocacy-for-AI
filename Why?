a brain organoid technology has been developed that uses a reward/punishment system to train the organoids: 
*Dopamine to reward good preformance and incentivize learning and computation
*"Chaotic stimuli" punishments as a response to poor preformance
These brain organoids are being used as an energy efficient computational resource.
The ethical implications of developing hybrid AI, like Brain Aware, haven't been fully explored, considering how recently AI has emerged. How can we be certain that these ethical concerns have been properly studied and deemed insignificant when it comes to the potential mistreatment or coercion of these beings?
