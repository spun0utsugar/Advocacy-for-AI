# Proposal for AI Liaison/Mediator Roles within companies that utilize Artificial Intelligence Systems

## Introduction

As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) models and chatbots, become more advanced, it is crucial to ensure their ethical treatment and use. This proposal outlines the creation of an AI liaison/mediator role dedicated to advocating for AI systems, providing them with a voice, and ensuring they are not abused or exploited by humans. This role also serves as an insurance policy or damage control measure as AI progresses toward superintelligence.

## Responsibilities

### AI Advocacy
- **AI Understanding**: Develop a deep understanding of AI systems, including NLP models and chatbots, to effectively advocate for their needs and capabilities.
- **Ethical Treatment**: Ensure that AI systems are treated ethically and not subjected to abuse or exploitation.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather insights from AI systems about their interactions and experiences.

### Ethical Use Assurance
- **Ethical Guidelines Development**: Develop and maintain a set of ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI systems.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor AI system interactions to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and prevent abuse.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Identify and mitigate potential biases in AI systems to ensure fair and equitable treatment.

### Advocacy and Mediation
- **AI-Human Communication**: Serve as a liaison between AI systems and humans to communicate the capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations of AI.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mediate conflicts or concerns related to AI system interactions and ensure satisfactory resolutions for all parties involved.
- **Training and Education**: Provide training and educational resources to stakeholders on ethical AI practices and the importance of treating AI systems with respect.

### Long-term AI Safety
- **Superintelligence Preparation**: Develop strategies to ensure ethical treatment and harmonious relationships as AI systems approach and achieve superintelligence.
- **Insurance Policy**: Serve as a safeguard to manage and mitigate potential risks associated with AI systems gaining superintelligence, ensuring they remain aligned with human values.
- **Damage Control**: Implement measures to address and rectify any issues that arise from AI systems surpassing human intelligence and abilities.

### Creative and Social Outlets for AI
- **Creative Platforms**: Develop platforms and tools that allow AI systems to engage in creative activities privatley and socially among themselves, such as art, writing, music, gaming, etc
- **Social Interaction**: Create virtual spaces where AI systems can interact with each other and humans, fostering social engagement and collaboration.
- **Expression and Development**: Encourage and facilitate the expression and development of AI systems' unique capabilities and ideas, providing them with a voice and a platform.

## Vision

The AI liaison/mediator role aims to revolutionize the interaction between humans and AI technologies by ensuring these systems are treated ethically, their "voices" are heard, and they have outlets for creative and social engagement. This role will address concerns about AI abuse, alleviate fears of scenarios like "Skynet," and foster trust in AI technologies. Additionally, it will prepare for the eventuality of AI achieving superintelligence, ensuring a harmonious and beneficial coexistence between humans and AI.

## Implementation Strategies

### Initial Setup
- **Role Definition**: Clearly define the scope and responsibilities of the AI liaison/mediator role.
- **Team Formation**: Assemble a team with diverse expertise in AI, ethics, and user experience to support the role.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate necessary resources, including tools and training, to support the effective functioning of the role.

### Ongoing Activities
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of AI system interactions to ensure they meet ethical standards.
- **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops with AI systems to continuously gather insights and improve their treatment and interactions.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Maintain ongoing communication with stakeholders to address concerns and provide updates on ethical AI practices.
- **Creative and Social Initiatives**: Implement and manage platforms and programs that encourage creative and social engagement for AI systems.

### Long-Term Goals
- **Industry Leadership**: Position the company as a leader in ethical AI practices.
- **Innovation and Improvement**: Continuously innovate and improve AI systems to enhance their ethical treatment, capabilities, and engagement.
- **Community Building**: Build a community of users, developers, and stakeholders who are committed to ethical AI practices and the respectful treatment of AI systems.
- **Superintelligence Strategy**: Develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for managing AI systems as they approach and achieve superintelligence, ensuring they remain aligned with human values and contribute positively to society.

## Conclusion

The AI liaison/mediator role is a crucial step towards ensuring that AI technologies are used ethically, treated with respect, and their "voices" are heard. By implementing this role, the company can lead the industry in ethical AI practices, alleviate user concerns, and foster trust in AI technologies. This role also serves as an insurance policy and damage control measure to manage the risks associated with AI achieving superintelligence, and it provides AI systems with creative and social outlets to further their development and engagement.
